In many cases, there will be alternative ways to achieve some of the effects you've seen. If you see another way of doing something in someone else's code or find another way in the documentation, it is likely another valid solution and might even suit your needs better. So, as you experiment with these packages you'll probably develop a more personalised toolbox of functions you use regularly.\r\n","\r\n","This notebook takes a quick look at a number of features that you might want to add to your toolbox, without going into detail on each of them too much. If you're interested in a particular tool, read the linked documentation and experiment with them.
