Given a series of intial values, a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved to solve the progression of the system. For instance, the rate of change of the number of bacteria $N(t)$ in a growth medium might be described as:\r\n","\r\n","$\\frac{\\textrm{d}N(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = \\alpha N((t)$\r\n","\r\n","where $\\alpha$ is a growth rate. If there are initially 10 bacteria at $t=0$, the number of bacteria as a function of time can be solved as follows:\r\n","\r\n","$N(t)=10e^{\\alpha t}$\r\n","\r\n","This example could be solved analytically, but other systems of equations are more complex. In this case, SciPy's ```scipy.integrate.odeint``` function can be very useful for calcualting the evolution of a physical system over time.\r\n","\r\n","```scipy.integrate.odeint``` can solve the time-progression of a collection of values, presented as a vector. The function requires another function be passed to it which describes the system of equations which give the derivative as a function of the values passed to it and the current time of the system as arguments.\r\n","\r\n","It also takes the initial value of the system (as an array) and an array of times for which the values of the equations to be solved for are to be found. It may optionally take a tuple of values which will be passed as arguments to the function which calcualtes the derivative. This means the values used in the derivative function don't need to be hard-coded in the function.\r\n","\r\n","As an example, we'll consider the [Lorenz system of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system), which arises in simplified models of a number of physical systems including lasers, electric circuits and chemical reactions. The system of equations governing the derivative of its three variables ($x$, $y$ and $z$) are as follows:\r\n","\r\n","$\r\n","\\frac{\\textrm{d}x(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = \\sigma(y - x)\\\\\r\n","\\frac{\\textrm{d}y(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = x(\\rho - z) - y\\\\\r\n","\\frac{\\textrm{d}z(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = xy - \\beta z\r\n","$\r\n","\r\n","Because we are solving for three variables as a function of time, the arrays which hold the state of the system at a particular time (or the rate of change of the system at a particular time) will be one-dimensional arrays with a size of 3.\r\n","\r\n","$\\beta$, $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$ are parameters which define the behaviout od the system. By picking values of 10, 8/3 and 28, we make the system  chaotic, which means we expect some interesting results.\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZOPpEATYH7AH"},"source":["import numpy as np\r\n","from scipy.integrate import odeint\r\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n","\r\n","# This function returns an array described the rate of change (i.e. [dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt]) of the system\r\n","# It accepts a vector describing the current state (i.e. [x, y, z]) of the system and the current time\r\n","# The parameters sigma, beta and rho are used to accept their values from the tuple of arguments passed to odeint\r\n","# To be used to provide the derivative to odeint, extra arguments (sigma, beta, rho) is not required by odeint\r\n","# However, this pattern allows \r\n","def derivative(vec, t, sigma, beta, rho):\r\n","  # Create the array to hold the rate of change of the system\r\n","  result = np.zeros(3)\r\n","\r\n","  # Calculate the rates of change\r\n","  result[0] = sigma * (vec[1] - vec[0])\r\n","  result[1] = vec[0] * (rho - vec[2]) -vec[1]\r\n","  result[2] = vec[0] * vec[1] - beta * vec[2]\r\n","\r\n","  # Return the rate of change\r\n","  return(result)\r\n","\r\n","# Set up the array of times at which the state of the system will be calcualted\r\n","t = np.arange(0, 20, 0.01)\r\n","\r\n","# Create the values representing the initial state of the system, i.e. [x(0)=1, y(0)=2, z(0)=3]\r\n","initial_value = np.array([1,2,3])\r\n","\r\n","# Set up the parameters of the system\r\n","sigma = 10\r\n","beta = 8/3\r\n","rho = 28\r\n","\r\n","# Calculate the time series of values\r\n","# The returned value contains the state of the system at each of the requested times\r\n","# The first dimension of time_series represents the different times\r\n","# The second dimension represents the different values of the system, e.g. [x, y, z]\r\n","# For instance time_series[10, 1] represents the value of y at the 11th time\r\n","time_series = odeint(derivative, initial_value, t, args = (sigma, beta, rho))\r\n","\r\n","# Print the output shape\r\n","print(\"Output shape: \", time_series.shape)\r\n","#Print the times array (numpy skips the middle values for a large array)\r\n","print(\"Time: \", t)\r\n","# Print the first values of the system\r\n","print(\"First: \", time_series[0,:])\r\n","#Print the last values of the system\r\n","print(\"Last: \", time_series[-1,:])\r\n","\r\n","# The rest of this is required to plot the figures\r\n","# Particularly if you're unfamiliar with matplotlib, you can ignore it\r\n","fig = plt.figure()\r\n","plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)\r\n","fig = plt.figure(figsize=plt.figaspect(4))\r\n","\r\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 1, 1)\r\n","ax.plot(t, time_series[:, 0])\r\n","ax.set_title('x(t)')\r\n","\r\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 1, 2)\r\n","ax.plot(t, time_series[:, 1])\r\n","ax.set_title('y(t)')\r\n","\r\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 1, 3)\r\n","ax.plot(t, time_series[:, 2])\r\n","ax.set_title('z(t)')\r\n","\r\n","ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 1, 4, projection='3d')\r\n","ax.plot(time_series[:,0], time_series[:,0], time_series[:,2])\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","plt.show()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EDmQfguYWI3L"},"source":["## Exercise\r\n","\r\n","A predator-prey cycle describes a dynamic system where the number of members of a prey species and a predator species are linked.
